A 2020 official estimate reported a population of 1,136,008 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in the country, after Almaty, which had been the capital until

 The city became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997; since then it has grown and developed economically into one of the most modern cities in Central Asia. In 2021, the government selected Nur-Sultan as one of the 10 priority destinations for tourist development.</p>
<p>As of January 2020, the population of Nur-Sultan (Astana) is 1,136,008 which is over double the 2002 population of 493,000.<p>

<h3>Emergence</h3>

It was founded in 1824 as a Russian military outpost and became an administrative centre in 1868. Its population had reached 33,000 when it was made an oblast (province) centre in 1939. The city’s importance was greatly enhanced during the Soviet period by the government’s Virgin and Idle Lands Campaign of the mid-1950s—Tselinograd was Russian for “City of the Virgin Lands”—and by the city’s role as capital of a kray (region) that united the five northern provinces of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1960–65. There was much new construction and the establishment of various research and higher educational institutions (teacher training, agriculture, medicine, and engineering and construction).

<h3>The City's Development after Independence</h3> 

The city’s name was changed to <b>Aqmola</b> (“White Grave”) in 1992 following Kazakhstan’s independence. In 1994 the Kazakh government resolved to transfer the national capital from Almaty to Aqmola, a process completed in 1997, and the city’s name was again changed, to Astana (“Capital”), the following year. Kazakh Pres. Nursultan Nazarbayev spent vast sums of the country’s oil profits on a drastic expansion and reconstruction of Astana. The government hired Japanese architect Kurokawa Kishō to design the plan for Astana’s new broad avenues and blue-and-gold buildings, including the Presidential Palace. Nazarbayev also employed British architect Sir Norman Foster to design the new Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a 203-foot- (62-metre-) high pyramid that includes, among other things, a library and an opera house. The city continued to develop rapidly throughout Nazarbayev’s presidency, and, on March 20, 2019, the day after he left office, the city was renamed <b>Nur-Sultan </b>in his honour.
